Leave a question and your name and hopefully someone will get back to you.
This file can be used to essentially create a FAQ for our project so we can work on it without being online at the same time.

1.   Gameplay is quick. One person can finish multiple targets before they have access to a computer. How will they get their next target on the go?
     Can't people just say who their target is instead of giving their password? Changes can still be logged here, but maybe not in real time.
     This project seems much better for the start and end of the game than the middle.
