Parser - structure / syntax

file -> lexer -> list of tokens with no meaning

parser figures out what needs to go AFTER each token


if a token is an identifier (variable/function)
    the only thing that comes after that is
        value
        nothing

parser language examples:

#identifier can have 0 or 1 argument
IDENTIFIER { }

IDENTIFIER DOUBLE {
    symbol table update
}
#sphere takes 4 doubles
SPHERE DOUBLE DOUBLE DOUBLE DOUBLE {
    store a call to sphere
}

IF LPAREN BOOL STATEMENT RPAREN STATEMENT {}

IF LPAREN BOO LSTATEMENT RPAREN LBRACE STATEMENT RBRACE {}

regular expression stuff
    \- escape the - sign. means the character '-' rather than - used in
     an expression like [0-9]

     ? means 0 or one of the expression preceding. e.g. \-? means possibly         a - sign.

     . means anything (wildcard)
     * means 0 or more of the thing preceding
     

parser (mdl.y, mdl.l)
        SYMTAB = symbol table
        op = array that stores all operations from lexer output

        struct command{
               int opcode;
             union{
                #structs
             }
        }

a union is like a struct, but only contains one of its types when declared

e.g. union foo{
     double x;
     char a;
}

union foo u;
u.x = 4;
u.a = 'a'; #ERROR
